@article{Cooke2004,
abstract = {Abstract Since 1995, several stocks of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) have begun upriver spawning migrations significantly earlier than previously observed. In some years, the timing of peak migration has shifted more than 6 weeks. Coincident with this early migration are high levels of en route and pre-spawning mortality, occasionally exceeding 90{\%}. These phenomena pose risks to the perpetuation of these fisheries resources. At present, although there are many competing hypotheses (e.g., energetics, osmoregulatory dysfunction, oceanic conditions, parasites) that may account for early migration and high mortality, there are no definitive answers, nor any causal evidence that link these issues. With poor predictive ability in the face of uncertainty, fisheries managers have been unable to effectively allocate harvest quotas, while ensuring that sufficient fish are able to not only reach the spawning sites, but also successfully reproduce. If trends in mortality rates continue, several imp...},

abstract = {Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks throughout the southern part of their North American range have experienced declines in productivity over the past two decades. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon stocks have also experienced recent declines in productivity by investigating temporal and spatial trends in productivity of 99 wild North American pink and chum salmon stocks. We used a combination of population dynamics and time series models to quantify individual stock trends as well as common temporal trends in pink and chum salmon productivity across local, regional, and continental spatial scales. Our results indicated widespread declines in productivity of wild chum salmon stocks throughout Washington (WA) and British Columbia (BC) with 81{\%} of stocks showing recent declines in productivity, although the exact form of the trends varied among regions. For pink salmon, the majority of stocks in WA and BC (65{\%}) did not have strong temporal trends in productivity; however, all stocks that did have trends in productivity showed declining productivity since at least brood year 1996. We found weaker evidence of widespread declines in productivity for Alaska pink and chum salmon, with some regions and stocks showing declines in productivity (e.g., Kodiak chum salmon stocks) and others showing increases (e.g., Alaska Peninsula pink salmon stocks). We also found strong positive covariation between stock productivity series at the regional spatial scale for both pink and chum salmon, along with evidence that this regional-scale positive covariation has become stronger since the early 1990s in WA and BC. In general, our results suggest that common processes operating at the regional or multi-regional spatial scales drive productivity of pink and chum salmon stocks in western North America and that the effects of these process on productivity may change over time.},

abstract = {Abstract We evaluated the effects of past and future trends in temperature and discharge in the Fraser River on the migratory performance of the early Stuart population of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka. Fish of lower condition exhibited disproportionately higher mortality during the spawning run, elucidating a critical link between energetic condition and a fish's ability to reach the spawning grounds. We simulated spawning migrations by accounting for energetic demands for an average individual in the population from the time of entry into the Fraser River estuary to arrival on the spawning grounds (about 1,200 km upstream) and estimated energy expenditures for the average migrant during 1950–2001. The model output indicates relatively high interannual variability in migration energy use and a marked increase in energy demands in recent years related to unusually high discharges (e.g., 1997) and warmer than average water temperature (e.g., 1998). We examined how global climate change might effect dis...},

abstract = {Trawl studies from 1998 to 2009 indicated that juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and Pacific herring Clupea pallasii represented 98{\%} of the fish in the surface waters of the Strait of Georgia during the day in the spring and early summer. Standardized catches of all juvenile Pacific salmon in the trawl surveys were lowest in 2007. Catches of young-of-the-year Pacific herring were also extremely low in 2007. Three years later, the 2007 year-class had the lowest recruitment to the fishery in recorded history. In 2007, juvenile coho salmon O. kisutch and Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha were small and had the lowest condition of the fish in all surveys as well as a high percentage of empty stomachs. The early marine survival of coho salmon in 2007 and the total survival in 2008 were exceptionally poor. Trawl catches of juvenile chum salmon O. keta in 2007 were the lowest of all surveys. Adult chum salmon from these juveniles that returned in 2010 had extremely poor survival. Juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka that entered the Strait of Georgia in the spring of 2007 and returned to the Fraser River as adults in 2009 also had such exceptionally poor marine survival that a judicial inquiry was conducted to determine the causes. The synchronous poor growth, survival, or both of all of themajor species in the surface waters of the Strait ofGeorgia in the spring of 2007 indicated that there was a common cause which we propose as poor food production. The causes of the high mortality likely represented a unique extreme in the variability of the factors that normally affect the survival of juvenile Pacific salmon and Pacific herring in the early marine period in the Strait of Georgia.},

@article{Duffy2005,
abstract = {Puget Sound could differentially represent either a simple migration corridor or an important rearing environment during the potentially critical early marine residence period for different species of Pacific salmon. Recent declines in various stocks of Puget Sound salmon could reflect degraded rearing conditions or changes in temporal-spatial utilization patterns by juvenile salmon in Puget Sound, and these patterns could vary between habitats and regions of Puget Sound in response to different environmental conditions or hatchery practices. In April-September 2001 and 2002, we evaluated spatial and temporal differences in distribution and size structure among juvenile chum, pink, coho, and chinook salmon at delta and nearshore habitats in a northern and southern region of Puget Sound, Washington. Water was consistently warmer (8-18.8°C) and less saline (0.0-27.7) in the northern (N) than in the southern region (S: 9.5-14.6°C, 13.0-30.4). Salinities were lower and water temperatures more variable in delta sites than exposed nearshore marine sites. Peak densities of juvenile salmon coincided at delta and nearshore sites within sampling regions but differed between regions. Nearshore densities were highest during April-June with pink and chum salmon generally preceding chinook and coho salmon, and peak catch rates of most species occurred in May. A second, late pulse of chinook salmon also occurred during July at northern sites. Juvenile chinook salmon were predominantly of hatchery origin in the southern region (98{\%}), and of mixed origin in the northern region (44{\%} marked hatchery fish) during 2002. The lengths of chinook and chum salmon in nearshore regions increased steadily through time, whereas pink and coho salmon varied inconsistently. Mean sizes of juvenile salmon were slightly but consistently smaller at delta than nearshore sites and at northern versus southern sites. Hatchery chinook salmon were slightly larger than their unmarked counterparts. Extended nearshore residence times (their seasonal duration in the catches) and significant increases in size suggested that nearshore environments may be particularly important rearing areas for juvenile chinook salmon in the northern region, and chum salmon in the southern region. Regional differences in the magnitude and timing of hatchery inputs, salinity, and water temperature likely affect the timing, nearshore use, size, and growth potential for juvenile salmon entering different regions of Puget Sound and could differentially influence subsequent marine survival. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Knowledge of the migratory habits of juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. is required to test the hypothesis that ocean food resources are a limiting factor in their production. Using DNA stock identification techniques, we reconstructed the regional and seasonal changes in the stock composition of juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka (n ¼ 4,062) collected from coastal Washington to the Alaska Peninsula in coastal trawl surveys fromMay to February 1996–2007. Individuals were allocated to 14 regional populations. The majority were allocated to stocks from the Fraser River system (42{\%}), while west coast Vancouver Island stocks accounted for 15{\%}of the total catch; Nass and Skeena River sockeye salmon constituted 14{\%}and Rivers Inlet 6{\%}of the total. The remainder of the stocks identified individually contributed less than 5{\%}of the sockeye salmon analyzed. These proportions generally reflected the abundance of those populations. In spring and summer, the majority of fish were caught in close proximity to their rivers of origin, lending further support to the allocations. By fall, sockeye salmon were caught as far north and west as the Alaska Peninsula, themajority being caught fromcentralBritishColumbia to SoutheastAlaska. Juvenile sockeye salmon generally disappeared from the coast by winter, suggesting dispersion into the Gulf of Alaska. Within each region, the proportional stock composition changed as the seasons progressed, with northward (and in some cases, rapid) migration along the coast.We also demonstrated stock-specific differences inmigration patterns. For each stock identified, body size and energy density were higher at northern latitudes, suggesting that there is an environmental or food web influence on growth or that faster growing fish initiated their northward migration earlier.},
