\begin{abstract}
The majority of out-migrating juvenile Fraser River salmon
(\emph{Oncorhynchus} spp.) pass northwest through the Strait of Georgia,
the Discovery Islands, and Johnstone Strait. The Discovery Islands to
Johnstone Strait leg of the migration is a region of poor survival for
juvenile salmon relative to the Strait of Georgia. The Hakai Institute
Juvenile Salmon Program has been monitoring key components of this
migration since 2015 to better understand drivers of early marine
survival. Here we present key aspects of the 2018 migration in
comparison to averages from the 2015--2018 study period, which we use to
define `normal'. In 2018 sockeye (\emph{Oncorhynchus nerka}), pink
(\emph{O. gorbuscha}), and chum (\emph{O. keta}) all migrated earlier
than normal. The median capture date was May 23rd for sockeye, five days
earlier than normal; and June 12 for pink and chum, which is five days
earlier for pink and three days earlier than normal for chum. Sea lice
prevalence was lower than normal for sockeye, pink, and chum. Notably,
there were no \emph{Lepeophtheirus salmonis} sea lice observed in
Johnstone Strait in 2018. Sockeye were longer than normal in 2018
whereas pink and chum were smaller than normal. Sea surface temperatures
in May and June were the warmest on record in the study period
(2015--2018). Pink salmon dominated the catch in 2018, followed by chum,
and then sockeye.

\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

Pacific salmon (\emph{Oncorhynchus} spp.) traverse numerous ecosystems
during different phases of their lifecycle, which makes it challenging
to understand the mechanisms that influence survivorship. During their
migrations, salmon are subjected to risks associated with each new
environment they encounter (Cooke et al. 2004; McKinnell et al. 2012).
The risks and associated mortality from the sum of these migrations can
be understood in aggregate by quantifying the productivity (recruits per
spawner) of a certain stock (Malick and Cox 2016; Grant, MacDonald, and
Michielsens 2017). Salmon are an excellent indicator species because
they integrate terrestrial, lacustrine, fluvial, estuarine, nearshore
marine, and high-seas conditions; a problem in any one of these
environments will be reflected in the productivity of salmon stocks
(Rand et al. 2006). To better manage and predict the productivity of
salmon stocks we need estimates of mortality and an understanding of the
factors driving mortality in each landscape that salmon traverse. One
such area in which we lack understanding is the early marine environment
(Grant, MacDonald, and Michielsens 2017). Juvenile salmon are
particularly vulnerable during the early marine phase of their life
history because they are undergoing physiological adaptations to a
saline environment (Orsi et al. 2000; Duffy, Beauchamp, and Buckley
2005; Tucker et al. 2009; Beamish et al. 2012).

The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program has been monitoring juvenile
salmon migrations in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait (Figure
\ref{fig:map}) since 2015 in an effort to understand what factors may be
influencing early marine survival of sockeye, pink, and chum (Hunt et
al. 2018). The effects of pathogens, parasites, predators, and the
impacts of climate change on food web dynamics may be amplified during
this stressful transition period. Factors on which we are currently
monitoring and reporting include migration dynamics, growth, parasites
and pathogens, and the ocean's physical condition.

\section*{Methods}\label{methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Methods}

\subsection*{Field methods}\label{field-methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Field methods}

See Hunt et al. (2018) for a detailed description of field and lab
methods. Briefly, we collect juvenile salmon weekly from the Discovery
Islands and Johnstone Strait during their northward migration from the
Strait of Georgia to Queen Charlotte Strait near northern Vancouver
Island, British Columbia. Sampling is conducted from May to July each
year since 2015 using purse seine nets (bunt: 27 m x 9 m with 13 mm
mesh; tow: 46 m x 9 m with 76 mm mesh). We sample in nearshore marine
habitats with depth \textgreater{} 10 m and effectively sample sockeye
(\emph{Oncorhynchus nerka}), pink (\emph{O. gorbuscha}), chum (\emph{O.
keta}) and incidentally capture coho (\emph{O. kisutch}), chinook
(\emph{O. tshawytschya}) and Pacific herring (\emph{Clupea pallasii}).
All animal care was in accordance with Animal Care Guidelines under
permit A16-0101. Temperature data were collected by deploying an RBR
conductivity, temperature, and depth profiler to depths \textgreater{}
30 m at station QU39 ( Figure \ref{fig:map}) in the northern Strait of
Georgia.

\subsection*{Statistical methods}\label{statistical-methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Statistical methods}

All metrics reported are in relation to the time series average
(2015-2018). The mean for each parameter of interest was calculated for
all years combined, and the z-score was calculated for each parameter to
determine the number of standard deviations away from the mean a given
parameter was in each year.

\(Z = {\frac{x_i - \bar X}{{S}}}\)

Annual migration timing for each species was measured by calculating the
median date of capture in the Discovery Islands, the date at which the
50 percent of the fish passed through the region. To visualize migration
timing we plotted cumulative catch abundance between May 1st and July
9th each year and fit a logistic growth line. Species proportions were
calculated by dividing the total number of each species caught that
season across all seines by the sum of all species caught that season.
Fork length distributions were visualized by calculating density
estimates from fork length data. The prevalence of sealice was
calculated as the number of individuals of a host species infected with
a particular parasite species divided by Number of hosts examined
(Margolis et al. 1990). Sea surface was defined as the top 30 m of the
water column. The mean temperature from which to compare any single year
to was calculated from the top 30 m of the water column in May and June
from all years. To visualize temperature anomalies we applied a loess
regression to sea surface temperatures from all four years to develop a
model that would represent the seasonal trend.

\section*{Results}\label{results}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Results}

The heatmap below summarizes the amount of variation each parameter
exhibits over the past four years by visualizing the number of standard
deviations from the time-series average (Z-score) (Figure
\ref{fig:heatmap}). Peak migration date, parasite loads, and fork
lengths were all calculated for sockeye.

Sea-surface temperatures in May and June at QU39 were warmer than
normal, or 1.33 standard deviations greater than the time series mean.
The peak migration date in the Discovery Islands occurred earlier than
average in 2018 (-0.71 SD). Across the Discovery Islands and Johnstone
Strait, parasite loads were lower than average (-0.98 SD), and fork
lengths were longer than average (0.62 SD).

Blue colour indicates less than average, white indicates average, red indicates greater than average. Peak migration date is based on the median date of sockeye capture in the Discovery Islands.  Mean sea-surface temperature is 30 m depth integrated temperature from station QU39 in the Northern Strait of Georgia from May and June. Parasite load is the average prevalence of all sea lice species in their motile life stage for both the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait regions combined.}\label{fig:heatmap}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Migration Timing}\label{migration-timing}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Migration Timing}

The bulk of the sockeye migration in the Discovery Islands occurred
earlier in 2018 when compared to the time-series's four-year average
(Figure \ref{fig:mt}). The median date of capture for 2018 sockeye was
May 22nd, whereas the time series average was May 27th. Conversely, the
2018 sockeye migration occurred later than normal in Johnstone Strait,
where the median date of capture was June 6th, which is two days later
than the time-series average. See Table \ref{tab:mtdi} and Table
\ref{tab:mtjs} for the interqurtile range of migration timing for
sockeye, pink, and chum in 2018, contrasted to the time series averages
for the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait, respectively. Based on
the comparison of peak migration dates between the two zones, we
estimate that the average residence time of juvenile salmon in the
Discovery Islands for 2018 was approximately two weeks.

\subsection*{Species Proportions}\label{species-proportions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Species Proportions}

Pink salmon dominated the catch in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone
Strait in 2018, which is the first time observed in the time-series
(Figure \ref{fig:prop}). This may be due to post-smolts being from the
dominant odd-year pink returning broodlines (Krkošek et al. 2011; T. D.
Beacham et al. 2012; Irvine et al. 2014) coupled with Fraser River
sockeye from the weak 2016 brood year, which was lowest recorded return
in 100 years (McKinnell et al. 2012; Grant, MacDonald, and Michielsens
2017; Pacific Salmon Commission 2017).

\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{peer_j_migration_dynamics_files/figure-latex/prop-1} \caption{The annual proportion of fish captured in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait combined.}\label{fig:prop}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Length}\label{length}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Length}

Fish lengths varied between regions, species and year (Figure
\ref{fig:length}). Sockeye in 2018 were longer than the time-series
average (Discovery Islands M = 116, 95\% CI = 113, 120; Johnstone Strait
M = 117, CI = 113, 122). However, pink were shorter than average in both
regions (8.3 \% in the Discovery Islands and 4.4 \% Johnstone Strait),
as well as chum (8.1 \% in the Discovery Islands and 3.6 \% Johnstone
Strait).

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Parasite Loads}\label{parasite-loads}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Parasite Loads}

The prevalence of motile (pre-adult and adult life stage) sea lice in
2018 was the lowest recorded in the time-series (Figure
\ref{fig:sealice}). Notably, no \emph{Lepeophtheirus salmonis} were
detected on sockeye in Johnstone Strait, despite being present in the
Discovery Islands. Pink salmon appeared to have higher counts of
\emph{Caligus clemensi} in 2018 compared to chum and sockeye.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Sea Surface Temperature}\label{sea-surface-temperature}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Sea Surface Temperature}

Sea surface temperatures between May and July of 2018 were warmer than
the time series average. (Figure \ref{fig:sst})

Normal is the solid black line which is a loess regression based on temperatures from 2015-2018. The shaded grey area is 1 SE of the loess regression. The black dots are the daily minimum and maximum temperatures observed over the time series.}\label{fig:sst}
