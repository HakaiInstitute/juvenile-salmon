\begin{abstract}
The majority of out-migrating juvenile Fraser River salmon pass
northwest through the Strait of Georgia, the Discovery Islands, and
Johnstone Strait. The Discovery Islands to Johnstone Strait leg of the
migration is a region of poor survival for juvenile salmon relative to
the Strait of Georgia. The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program has
been monitoring key components of this migration since 2015 to better
understand drivers of early marine survival. Here we present key aspects
of the 2018 migration in comparison to averages from the 2015---2018
study period, which we use to define `normal'. In 2018 sockeye, pink,
and chum all migrated earlier than normal. The median capture date was
May 23rd for sockeye, five days earlier than normal, and June 12 for
pink and chum which is five days earlier for pink and three days earlier
than normal for chum. Sea lice prevalence was lower than normal for
sockeye, pink, and chum. Notably there were no \emph{Lepeoptheirus
salmonis} sea lice observed in Johnstone Strait in 2018. Sockeye were
longer than normal in 2018 whereas pink and chum were smaller than
normal. Sea surface temperature in May and June was the warmest on
record in the study period (2015---2018). Pink salmon dominated the
catch in 2018, followed by chum and then sockeye.

\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

Pacific salmon (\emph{Oncorhynchus} spp.) traverse a number of aquatic
landscapes during different phases of their lifecyle to reach a habitat
which ultimately offers some reward. While undergoing these migrations,
salmon are subjected to risks associated with each new environemnt they
encounter. The risks and associated mortality from the sum of these
migrations can be understood in aggregate by quantifying the
productivity (recruits per spawner) of a certain stock. Salmon are an
excellent indicator species beacuse they act as an integrator of
terrestrial, lacustrine, fluvial, estuarine, nearshore marine, and
high-seas conditions. A problem in any one of these environments will be
reflected in the productivity of salmon stocks. To better manage and
predict the producitivty of salmon stocks we need estimates of mortality
and an understanding of the factors driving mortality in each landscape
that salmon traverse. The early marine environment is one which
estimates of mortality and it's drivers, is lacking. Juvenile salmon are
particularly vulnerable during the early marine phase of their life
history because they are undergoing physiological adaptations to a
saline environment.

The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program has been monitoring juvenile
salmon migrations in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait (Figure
\ref{fig:map}) 2015 in an effort to understand what factors may be
influencing early marine survival of sockeye, pink, and chum (Hunt et
al. 2018). The effects of pathogens, parasites, predators, and the
impacts of climate change on food web dynamics may be amplified during
this stressful transition period and are the primary aspects of the
salmon migration we are monitoring and reporting on here.

\section*{Methods}\label{methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Methods}

\subsection*{Field methods}\label{field-methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Field methods}

See Hunt et al. (2018) for a detailed description of field and lab
methods. Briefly, we collect juvenile salmon weekly from the Discovery
Islands and Johnstone Strait during their northward migration from the
Strait of Georgia to Queen Charlotte Strait near northern Vancouver
Island, British Columbia. Sampling is conducted from May to July each
year since 2015 using purse seine nets (bunt: 27 m x 9 m with 13 mm
mesh; tow: 46 m x 9 m with 76 mm mesh). We sample in nearshore marine
habitats with depth \textgreater{} 10 m and effectively sample sockeye
(\emph{Oncorhynchus nerka}), pink (\emph{O. gorbuscha}), chum (\emph{O.
keta}) and invidentally capture coho (\emph{O. kisutch}), chinook
(\emph{O. tshawytschya}) and pacific herring (\emph{Clupea pallasii}).
All animal handling and specimen collection was in accordance with UBC's
Animal Animal Care Guidelines under permit A16-0101. Temperature data
were collected by deploying an RBR conductivity, temperature, and depth
profiler to depths \textgreater{} 30 m at station QU39 ( Figure
\ref{fig:map}) in the northern Strait of Georgia.

\subsection*{Statistical methods}\label{statistical-methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Statistical methods}

All metrics reported are in relation to the time series average
(2015---2018). The mean for each parameter of interest was calculated
for all years combined, and the z-score was calculated for each
parameter to determine the number of standard deviations away from the
mean a given parameter was in each year.

\(Z = {\frac{x_i - \bar X}{{S}}}\)

Annual migration timing for each species was measured by calculating the
median date of capture in the Discovery Islands, the date at which the
50 percent of the fish passed through the region. To visualize migration
timing we plotted cumulative catch abundance between May 1st and July
9th each year and fit a logistic growth line. Species proportions were
calculated by dividing the total number of each species caught that
season across all seines by the sum of all species caught that season.
Fork length distributions were visualized by calculating density
estimates from fork length data. The prevalence of sealice was
calculated as the number of individuals of a host species infected with
a particular parasite species divided by Number of hosts examined
(Margolis et al. 1990). Sea surface was defined as the top 30 m of the
water column. The mean temperature from which to compare any single year
to was calculated from the top 30 m of the water column in May and June
from all years. To visualize temperature anomalies we applied a loess
regression to sea surface temperatures from all four years to develop a
model that would represent the seasonal trend.

\section*{Results}\label{results}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Results}

The sea-surface temperature in May and June was higher than normal, and
sockeye peak migration date in the Discovery Islands was earlier than
normal in 2018. Parasite loads were less than normal, and lengths were
longer than normal (Figure \ref{fig:heatmap}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{peer_j_migration_dynamics_files/figure-latex/heatmap-1} \caption{This heatmap indicates the number of standard deviations (Z-score) from the time series average (2015-2018) for key migration parameters. Blue colour indicates less than average, white indicates average, red indicates greater than average, and grey indicates insufficient data. Mean sea-surface temperature is 30 m depth integrated temperature from station QU39 in the Northern Strait of Georgia from May and June. Peak migration date is based on the median date of fish capture in the Discovery Islands. Parasite load is the average prevalence of all sea lice species in their motile life stage for both the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait regions combined.}\label{fig:heatmap}

\subsection*{Migration Timing}\label{migration-timing}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Migration Timing}

Sockeye migration timing to the Discovery Islands in 2018 was: earlier
than normal for sockeye (Figure \ref{fig:mt}), later than normal for
pink, and later than normal for chum.
