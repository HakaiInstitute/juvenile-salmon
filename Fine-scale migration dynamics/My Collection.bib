abstract = {The size, condition, distribution, and migration pathways of juvenile Pacific salmon (pink, chum, sockeye, coho, and Chinook salmon) were examined along the eastern Bering Sea shelf during August through October 2002. Juvenile salmon were widely distributed across the eastern Bering Sea shelf, but species-specific distributional patterns were found. Juvenile sockeye and chum salmon were large during 2002, suggesting that growth rates were high during their first summer at sea. Seaward migratory pathways for juvenile salmon from Bristol Bay and the Kuskokwim and Yukon rivers were inferred from their size distributions along the eastern Bering Sea shelf, and differ from earlier migration models.},

@article{Beamish2003,
abstract = {Studies of the early ocean period of salmon life history conducted in the coastal areas off Canada's west coast are reviewed. The role of the ocean in the dynamics of salmon populations has received considerably less study than their life cycle in fresh water, even though Pacific salmon in general spend more time in the ocean than in fresh water and the survivals in the ocean are extremely low and variable. Feeding, growth and distribution studies from the late 1950s until the present have contributed to an improved appreciation of biology of salmon during the marine phase of their life history. However, conclusions about the processes that cause the high and variable mortality in the ocean remain speculative. How fishing impacts interact with natural processes also remain to be clarified. Recent studies have demonstrated that ocean and climate conditions are important contributors to the total marine mortality of a number of species, and to the stock and recruitment relationship. It is suggested that it is time to conduct the definitive studies that will identify the processes that regulate the survival of Pacific salmon throughout their entire life cycle. It is proposed that an international effort to study the early marine period is the way to change the current beliefs and speculations into explanations.},
annote = {Using the beam trawl on the Ricker, researchers found in 1990 that juvenile salmon were distributed further off-shore than previously thought, as much as 70 km offshore.

MASS project in Barkley sound found that Chum, sockeye and chinook competed for food; mid size copepods, euphausids, caldocerans during spring and early summer

Beamish and Mankhen found that the growth rate was not an important indicator of survival when loking at scales. This led to the idea that reaching a critical size before the first winter is likely more important than the actual growth rate.

Juvenile salmon remain on the contintenal shelf as the migrate north.

Stream type chinook migrate close to shore while ocean type typically migrate much further off shore.

Sockeye are always moving even when they get to the high seas where they migrate in circles in the Gulf of Alaska, apparently following plankton production.},

@article{Brodeur2003,
abstract = {Research on juvenile Pacific salmon in coastal U.S. waters began almost 50 years ago in Southeast Alaska, and has continued somewhat sporadically since then. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), through its various laboratories in Alaska and along the West Coast of the United States, has done much of the research on the early life history of many Pacific salmon stocks in all habitats of U.S. waters, including their period of residence in coastal and oceanic waters. In addition, several of the leading universities in this region (University of Washington, Oregon State University, University of Alaska) have contributed greatly to our knowledge of salmon in their early ocean residency. Much of the early research was done using fine-mesh purse seines, but recently surface fine-mesh trawl nets and gill nets have been used more widely. A large number of programs are actively sampling in coastal waters at the present time, and the geographic and temporal coverage is the most complete it has ever been. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of many of the studies that have been done, synthesize their major findings, and discuss some of the areas where we believe future efforts should be concentrated.},
